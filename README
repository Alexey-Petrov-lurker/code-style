# Test SSH key:
# 
# $ ssh -T git@github.com
# Hi %username%! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
# Change directory into the local clone of your repository (if you're not already there) and run:
# 
# git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/your-repository
# Now try editing a file (try the README) and then do:
# 
# $ git commit -am "Update README.md"
# $ git push
# You should not be asked for a username or password. If it works, your SSH key is correctly configured.
